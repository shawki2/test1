# Introduction

# Word Match

---

This interactivity application matches pairs word numbers to normal number. It does not accept to select two word numbers at the same time.

### Getting starting:

1. Clone it: git clone git@github.com:shawki2/xxxx.git
2. Install `npm i` or `npm install`
3. Locally, run `npm start` from `top level` folder to have hot reload.

### Approch:

This application matches word numbers to normal number. It does not accept to select two word numbers at the same time.

## Main Framework and Libraries:

- HTML
- CSS
- ES6
- JavaScript
- React

## Application architecture

I recreate the html in ReactJS and create two functions to deal with the user choices to select matching pairs (words and numbers).
The application displays a congratulations message on successful completion of the activity.

### Future improvements

I'd like to keep expanding this project to hone my existing skills, as well as to explore new technologies. Improve UI for better user experience
